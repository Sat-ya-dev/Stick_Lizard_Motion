# Stick_Lizard_Motion
This MATLAB project simulates the motion of a stick lizard using arrow keys (or WASD) for control. The stick lizard is represented by a series of connected line segments, and its motion is governed by rotation transformations applied to its constituent parts. 
The project involves initialization of lizard's head (pt) and all other points are described relative to pt. Rotation matrix is used to rotate a given point by a certain angle in anticlockwise direction and the getChar function is used to get ascii values of keyboard inputs which is used for controlling the movements of lizard.
Overall, this project provides an interactive visualization of stick lizard motion, demonstrating concepts of basic kinematics and rotation transformations in MATLAB.
